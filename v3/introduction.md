# Introduction

Welcome to the season 3 (V3)

## Does bAny has same value than token? <a href="is-time-a-stable-coin" id="is-time-a-stable-coin"></a>

With the creation of the bAny (3,3). it aspires to become an algorithmic reserve currency, initially backed by one unit of the backed token, and it will increase in time thanks by the fees collected via the bonds sale.

## bAny is backed by Any. <a href="time-is-backed-not-pegged-1" id="time-is-backed-not-pegged-1"></a>

Each bAny token is backed by 1 Any, during the first bond minting, but it will increase at each rebase. (bDAI is backed by DAI). As we said, the treasury backs every bAny with at least 1 Any, and every user, burning the token can redeem the backed amount. When the bAny:Any rate will be lower than the backed amount, this has the effect of pushing bAny price back up to the backed value.

The bToken floor price or intrinsic value is represented by TBA.

## How does it work? <a href="how-does-it-work" id="how-does-it-work"></a>

The bAny token has the same bonding/minting mechanism introduced by Olympus, to control the supply expansion. Bonding in the "Mint" page generates profit for the protocol, and the treasury uses the profit to mint new bAny token and distribute them to stakers. With LP bond, the protocol is able to accumulate liquidity to ensure the system stability.

## What is (üèù, üèù) for Defiville ? <a href="what-is-the-deal-with-hat-hat" id="what-is-the-deal-with-hat-hat"></a>

(üèù, üèù) will be the Defiville new motto. We love community and first of all we want the everyone can start to cooperate and give its contributor into the community. ISLA stakers will receive all different **bAny** tokens created into our world. Currently, there are three actions a user can take:

* _Staking _
* _Minting_ (_Bonding_)
* _Selling_&#x20;

Staking and minting are considered beneficiary to the protocol, while selling is considered detrimental. Staking and selling will also cause a price move, while bonding (minting) does not (we consider buying **bAny** from the market as a prerequisite of staking, thus causing a price move). If both actions are beneficiary, the actor who moves price also gets half of the benefit. If both actions are contradictory, the bad actor who moves price gets half of the benefit, while the good actor who moves price gets half of the downside (‚Ö©). If both actions are detrimental, which implies both actors are selling, they both get the worst possible outcome (‚ùå)!

Thus, given two actors, all scenarios of what they could do and the effect on the protocol are shown here:

* If we both stake, it is the best thing for both of us and the protocol.
* If one of us stakes and the other one bonds, it is also great because staking takes the **bAny** token off the market and put it into the protocol, while bonding provides liquidity and **bAny** for the treasury!&#x20;
* When one of us sells, it diminishes effort of the other one who stakes or bonds.
* When we both sell, it creates the worst outcome for both of us and the protocol.

## Why is PCV important? <a href="why-is-pcv-important" id="why-is-pcv-important"></a>

As the protocol controls the funds in its treasury, **bAny** can only be minted by the protocol, or rented. You can easily define the risk of your investment because you can be confident that the protocol will permit to rent 1 **Any** even if the price if below 1 **Any** price with the treasury assets, so it will bring the price over 1 **Any** again.

As the protocol accumulates more PCV, more runway is guaranteed for the stakers. This means the stakers can be confident that the current staking APY can be sustained for a longer term because the TBA is increasing in time. It can be seen as if this "floor price" that increases in time can guarantee that the price of the token can stay above it.&#x20;

## What is the point of buying it now when bAny trades at a very high premium? <a href="what-is-the-point-of-buying-it-now-when-time-trades-at-a-very-high-premium" id="what-is-the-point-of-buying-it-now-when-time-trades-at-a-very-high-premium"></a>

When you buy and stake any **bAny** token, you capture a percentage of the supply (market cap) which will remain close to a constant. This is because your staked **bAny** balance also increases along with the circulating supply. The implication is that if you buy **bAny** when the market cap is low, you would be capturing a larger percentage of the market cap.

## What is a rebase? <a href="what-is-a-rebase" id="what-is-a-rebase"></a>

Rebase is a mechanism by which your staked bAny balance increases automatically. When new bAny are minted by the protocol, a large portion of it goes to the stakers. Any bAny token has a rebase rate.

## What is Epoch? <a href="what-is-apy" id="what-is-apy"></a>

In Defiville, you can stake any bAny token supported into our world (in other world within our metaworld different token can be created). Staked **bAny** represents your principal, and the compound interest is added periodically on every epoch (8 hours) thanks to the rebase mechanism. the APY will grow exponentially over time.

## What is the bAny intrinsic value ? <a href="what-will-be-time-intrinsic-value-in-the-future" id="what-will-be-time-intrinsic-value-in-the-future"></a>

The intrinsic value is determined by the TAB, it is the treasury amount reserved for each token minted. For example, if the treasury could guarantee to back every bAny with 10 **Any**, the intrinsic value will be 10 **Any**. It can also be decided by the future DAO.

## How does the protocol manage to maintain the high staking APY? <a href="how-does-the-protocol-manage-to-maintain-the-high-staking-apy" id="how-does-the-protocol-manage-to-maintain-the-high-staking-apy"></a>

Let‚Äôs say the protocol targets an APY of 100,000%. This would translate to a rebase rate of about 0.6328%, or a daily growth of about 2%. Please refer to the [**equation**](https://wonderland.gitbook.io/wonderland/basics/faq#how-is-the-apy-calculated) above to learn how APY is calculated from the rebase rate.

If there are 100,000 **bAny** tokens staked right now, the protocol would need to mint an additional 2000 **bAny** to achieve this daily growth. This is achievable if the protocol can bring in at least 2000 **Any** daily from bond sales. If the protocol fails to achieve this, the APY of 100,000% cannot be guaranteed.

## Do I have to unstake and stake bAny on every epoch to get my rebase rewards? <a href="do-i-have-to-unstake-and-stake-time-on-every-epoch-to-get-my-rebase-rewards" id="do-i-have-to-unstake-and-stake-time-on-every-epoch-to-get-my-rebase-rewards"></a>

No. Once you have staked **bAny**, your staked **bAny** balance will auto-compound on every epoch. _That increase in balance represents your rebase rewards._

## How do I track my rebase rewards? <a href="how-do-i-track-my-rebase-rewards" id="how-do-i-track-my-rebase-rewards"></a>

You can track your rebase rewards by calculating the increase in your staked **bAny** balance.

1\. Record down the Current Index value on the staking page when you first stake your **bAny**. Let's call this the Start Index.

2\. After staking for some time, if you want to determine by how much your balance has increased, check the Current Index value again. Let's call this the End Index.

3\. By dividing the End Index by Start Index, you would get the ratio by which your staked **bAny** balance has increased.

$$
ratio = endIndex / startIndex
$$

## Is V3 Audited ?

&#x20;It is currently unaudited, the bonding mechanism is forked from the Olympus DAO, other contracts have been modified and others developed by scratch. One of the first community proposes will be to use Tasks funds for paying an official audits. DYOR before investing any fund.
