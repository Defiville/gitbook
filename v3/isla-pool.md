# ISLA Pool

With the launch of the V3, an ISLA staking pool will be opened into our world. ISLA is the official Defiville token, launched at the beginning of the season 1, it has a 7M max cap of circulation supply and no other token will be minted anymore.

Users will be able to stake ISLA for obtaining fees collected by the [bAny (3,3)](bany-3-3.md) protocol. Fees will be distributed in different **bAny** tokens. In this way ISLA stakers can also stake **bAny** tokens in the related pool to increase their APY.

During the first phase, you can buy ISLA, via Uniswap, on mainnet and bridge them to the polygon network. Later on we will give the way to buy ISLA directly on polygon.
