# Animals

Animals will be the first characters that will land in the Defiville world, they will play different important roles. First of all, they are avatars of our official game, launched during the upcoming season. Players need to hold at least one avatar to play the game. Also animals will be rewarded by &#x20;

## How to obtain an Animal ?

At every rebase, the protocol will mint new **bAny**, for bonders, stakers and for the DAO. In Defiville it won't be a Decentralized Autonomous Organization but a Decentralized Animals Organization. The total amount of **bAny** minted for the bonders, will be the same that for the DAO. The next rebase every bAny collected by the DAO will be put into Animals NFT, and they will be put in sale for bAny/Any LP token&#x20;
