# bAny (3,3)

## What is a bAny token ?

Every asset (ERC20, NFTAction) can be backed for creating the related bToken, a token with a backed amount represented by the native token, and this value will increase over time, thanks to fees collected by the bond sale. bAny tokens stakers, during the staking time can use its backed amount for anything they want but they have to deposit again them before withdrawing the bAny token staked.&#x20;

## How to buy bAny tokens ?

The protocol will put in sale bAny via the bonding mechanism introduced by Olympus DAO (OHM docet), and users can start to buy them at a discount price. In the first phase users will be able to buy bonds only using the related backed token (DAI for BDAI, USDC for BUSDC), and with the LP token it locks the bAny token for a vesting period.&#x20;

## How many bAny tokens will be minted ?

During the bonds sale, it will mint new bAny and distribute them to the bAny stakers. Every bAny has a treasury backed amount (TBA) "attacched", the amount reserved for each token into the treasury, and it will mint a new bAny token for every TBA collected during the bonds sales. &#x20;

* 1% will be dedicated increase the TBA (in the backed token)
* 99% will be dedicated to mint new bAny tokens:
  * &#x20;0.5% to ISLA stakers
  * &#x20;0.5% to MetaWorld DAO
  * 98% to bAny stakers&#x20;
