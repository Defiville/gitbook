# bAny (3,3)

## What is the bAny (3,3) framework ?

bAny is a framework, integrated by default in any world, useful for creating new tokens that will be distributed following the same mechanism introduced by Olympus, for its token, OHM. Bonders can buy tokens at a discount price, and the protocol, at every rebase will mint a certain number of new tokens. The DAO can set protocol parameters that enables them to control the token emission.or  Every new bAny token created using the framework has to follow an important rule, it has to be backed with the related Any token. BDAI can be backed only with DAI, BETH only with ETH, and so on so forth.

## What is a bAny token ?

Every asset (ERC20, NFTAction soon) can be used for creating the related **bAny **version, a token with a backed amount represented by the native **Any** token, and this backed value will increase over time, thanks to fees collected by the bond sales. **bAny** tokens stakers, during the staking time can use its backed amount for anything they want but they have to deposit again them before withdrawing the bAny token staked.&#x20;

## What is a bAny NFT action ?

Using the bAny framework, it will permit to mint an NFT Action for any type of **bAny** token. Users can choose any amount to lock into the NFT. The main benefits to mint an NFT is that users can start to earn new **bAny **token at every rebase, directly into the NFT.&#x20;

## What is the TBA value ?

The TBA (Treasury Backed amount) is the treasury value reserved for each **bAny** token, and it will increase over time. Every user that is locking bAny token into NFTs can use this TBA for whatever they want but they have to send back into the Action for burning it.

## How to buy bAny tokens ?

**bAny** tokens will be put in sale using the bonding mechanism introduced by Olympus DAO (OHM docet), users can buy **bAny** at a discount price, and they can redeem the bond amount linearly over time for the entire vesting period. **bAny** can be purchased only with the related **Any** token and using the **bAny/Any** LP token.
