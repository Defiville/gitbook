# bAny (3,3)

## What is the bAny (3,3) framework ?

bAny is a framework, integrated by default in any world, useful for creating new tokens that will be distributed following the same mechanism introduced by Olympus, for its token, OHM. Bonders can buy tokens at a discount price, and the protocol, at every rebase will mint a certain number of new tokens, based on protocol parameters for controlling the token emission. Every new **bAny** token created using the framework has to follow an important rule, it has to be backed only with the related **Any** token. **BDAI** can be backed only with **DAI**, **BETH** only with **ETH**, and so on so forth. So the framework will be used to create many different bAny tokens, everyone with a bonding market market independent by each other.

## What is a bAny token ?

Every asset (ERC20, NFTAction soon) can be used for creating the related **bAny **version, as explained above, a token with a backed amount represented by the native **Any** token. This backed value will increase over time, thanks to fees collected by the bond sales, and we call it **TBA **(Treasury Backed Amount), the value reserved for each token. **bAny** NFT action holders, can use (rent) its backed amount for anything they want, but keeping in mind that they have to return them into the NFT before burning it.&#x20;

## What is a bAny NFT action ?

Using the bAny framework, it will permit to mint an NFT Action for any type of **bAny** token. Users can choose any amount to lock into the NFT. The main benefits to mint an action is that users can start to earn new **bAny **token at every rebase, directly into the NFT and also as explained above, they can rent the backed amount reserved to the NFT.



## How to buy bAny tokens ?

**bAny** tokens will be put in sale using the bonding mechanism introduced by Olympus DAO (OHM docet), users will be able to buy **bAny** token at a **Any** token discount price, and they can redeem the bond amount linearly over time for the entire vesting period. Via bonding, **bAny** can be purchased only with the related **Any** token or using the **bAny/Any** LP token.
