## What is Staking

With the launch of the v3, users can start to stake ISLA to earns fees collected by the protocol, from any Btoken bonds sold.

## Which assets will be used to reward stakers ?

For any Btoken, fees will be collected directly in that token, so ISLA stakers will be able to collect rewards in different Btokens.
