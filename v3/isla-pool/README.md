# ISLA Pool

ISLA is the official Defiville token, launched at the beginning of the season 1, it has a 7M cap of circulation supply.

With the launch of the next season (v3) an ISLA staking pool will be opened. Users will be able to stake ISLA to obtain fees collected by the [bAny (3,3)](../bany-3-3.md) protocol. Fees will be distributed in different bAny tokens. In this way ISLA stakers can also stake bAny tokens in the related pool to increase their APY.
