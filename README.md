# Welcome

Welcome to Defiville islanders, an island populated by animals and pirates, where everyone has to take actions beneficial for the entire community. After the first 2 seasons with more than 1M of ISLA distributed to users, the next season (v3) is going to be launched, in a super fresh island to land and with a "loot" of prizes to win.

Also, with the MetaWorld framework, everyone will be able to create and customize its own world, forking our rules or creating them from scratch. Every building will be an NFT and users will be able to buy them for customizing their world.
